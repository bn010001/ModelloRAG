) Foreword
A broad range of places, such as campuses, office spaces, and shopping malls, are
covered by networks. You can access internal resources of your school, access internal
printers of your company to print documents, or access the Internet to browse news
through the networks.
These networks belong to campus networks and are generally constructed by
enterprises or organizations. Campus networks not only improve the operational
efficiency of enterprises, but also provide network access services for external users.
This chapter describes the basic architecture of a campus network and details how to
build a campus network.

A campus network is a local area network (LAN) that connects people and things in a specified area. Typically, a campus
network has only one management entity. If there are multiple management entries in an area, the area is considered to have
multiple campus networks.

The campus network scale is flexible depending on actual requirements. It can be a small
office home office (SOHO), a school campus, enterprise campus, park, or shopping center.
However, the campus network cannot be scaled out infinitely. Typically, large campuses, such
as university campuses and industrial campuses, are limited within several square kilometers.
Such campus networks can be constructed using local area network (LAN) technology. A
campus network beyond this scope is usually considered as a metropolitan area network
(MAN) and is constructed using the WAN technology.
Typical LAN technologies used on campus networks include IEEE 802.3-compliant Ethernet
(wired) technologies and IEEE 802.1 1-compliant Wi-Fi (wireless) technologies.

¢ Typical layers and areas of a campus network:
= Core layer: is the backbone area of a campus network, which is the data switching core.
It connects various parts of the campus network, such as the data center, management
center, and campus egress.
« Aggregation layer: is a middle layer of a campus network, and completes data
aggregation or switching. Some fundamental network functions, such as routing, QoS,
and security, are also provided at this layer.
« Access layer: As the edge of a campus network, this layer connects end users to the
campus network.
« Egress area: As the edge that connects a campus network to an external network, this
area enables mutual access between the two networks. Typically, a large number of
network security devices, such as intrusion prevention system (IPS) devices, anti-DDoS
devices, and firewalls, are deployed in this area to defend against attacks from external
networks.
« Data center area: has servers and application systems deployed to provide data and
application services for internal and external users of an enterprise.
a Network management area: Network management systems, including the SDN
controller, WAC, and eLog (log server), are deployed in this area to manage and monitor
the entire campus network.

Ga) ) Typical Architecture of Small Campus Networks
* Small campus networks are typically deployed in
scenarios where the number of access users is
small (several or dozens of users). A small campus
network can cover only one location, has a simple
architecture, and is constructed to enable mutual
access between internal resources.

« Amidsize campus network supports access of
hundreds to thousands of users.
¢« The modular design is introduced to midsize
campus networks, that is, the networks can be
partitioned by function. However, the number of
function modules is small. In most cases, a midsize
campus network is flexibly partitioned based on
service requirements.

and connect to multiple campuses in a city through
WANs. Typically, a large campus network provides
access services and allows traveling employees to
access their company's internal network through
technologies such as Virtual Private Network (VPN).

¢ Project implementation is a specific operation procedure for engineers to deliver projects.
Systematic management and efficient process are critical to successful project implementation.
« Routine O&M and troubleshooting are required to ensure the normal running of network
functions and support smooth provisioning of user services.
« As.users' services develop, the users’ requirements on network functions increase. If the
current network cannot meet service requirements, or potential problems are found while the
network is running, the network needs to be optimized.

¢« Dynamic IP address assignment or static IP address binding can be used for IP address
assignment. On a small or midsize campus network, IP addresses are assigned based on the
following principles:
« IP addresses of WAN interfaces on egress gateways are assigned by the carrier in static,
DHCP, or PPPoE mode. The IP addresses of the egress gateways need to be obtained from
the carrier in advance.
¢ It is recommended that servers and special terminals (such as punch-card machines, printing
servers, and IP video surveillance devices) use statically bound IP addresses.
¢ User terminal: It is recommended that the DHCP server be deployed on the gateway to
dynamically assign IP addresses to user terminals such as PCs and IP phones using DHCP.

Basic Service Design: Routing Design
« Routing design inside a campus network:
* Intra-network segment: After an IP address is allocated
using DHCP, a default route is generated by default and
Internet Agg-S1 functions as a Layer 3 gateway.
¢ Inter-network segment: The current network topology is
simple. You can deploy static routes on all devices that
need to forward Layer 3 data to meet the requirements.
No complex routing protocol needs to be deployed.

The routing design of a small or midsize campus network includes design of internal routes
and the routes between the campus egress and the Internet or WAN devices.
The internal routing design of a small or midsize campus network must meet the
communication requirements of devices and terminals on the campus network and enable
interaction with external routes. As the campus network is small in size, the network structure
is simple.
« AP: After an IP address is assigned through DHCP, a default route is generated by
default.
= Switch and gateway: Static routes can be used to meet requirements. No complex
routing protocol needs to be deployed.
The egress routing design meets the requirements of intranet users for accessing the Internet
and WAN. When the egress device is connected to the Internet or WAN, you are advised to
configure static routes on the egress device.

¢ In addition to planning the networking and data forwarding mode, you also need to perform the
following operations:
« Network coverage design: You need to design and plan areas covered by Wi-Fi
signals to ensure that the signal strength in each area meets user requirements and to
minimize co-channel interference between neighboring APs.
a Network capacity design: You need to design the number of APs required based on
the bandwidth requirements, number of terminals, user concurrency rate, and per-AP
performance. This ensures that the WLAN performance can meet the Internet access
requirements of all terminals.
«> AP deployment design: Based on the network coverage design, modify and confirm
the actual AP deployment position, deployment mode, and power supply cabling
principles based on the actual situation.
