OSI defines five functional models for network management:
© Configuration management: monitors network configuration information so that network administrators can generate, query,
and modify hardware and software running parameters and conditions, and configure services.
c Performance management: manages network performance so that the network can provide reliable, continuous, and low-
latency communication capabilities with as few network resources as possible.
c Fault management: ensures that the network is always available and rectifies faults as soon as possible.
c Security management: protects networks and systems from unauthorized access and attacks.
« Accounting management: records the network resource usage of users, charges users, and collects statistics on network resource
usage.

When the network scale is small, the CLI and web system are generally used for network management.
oO
Network administrators can log in to a device through HTTPS, Telnet, or the console port to manage the device.
These network management modes do not require any program or server to be installed on the network, and the cost is low.
Network administrators must have a good master of network knowledge and vendor-specific network configuration
commands.
These modes have great limitations when the network scale is large and the network topology is complex.

[=| ) SNMP-based Centralized Management
SNMP is a standard network management protocol widely used on TCP/IP networks. It provides a method for
managing NEs through a central computer that runs network management software, that is, a network
management station.
¢ Network administrators can use the NMS to query
information, modify information, and troubleshoot
faults on any node on the network, improving work
efficiency.
ee ¢ Network devices of different types and vendors are

Typical SNMP Architecture
On a network where SNMP is used for network management,
a network management system (NMS) functions as a network
management center and runs management processes. Each
managed device needs to run an agent process. The
management process and agent process communicate with
each other through SNMP messages.
An NMS is a system that uses SNMP to manage and monitor
network devices. The NMS software runs on NMS servers.
Managed devices are devices that are managed by the NMS
on the network.
The agent process runs on managed devices to maintain the
information data of the managed devices, respond to the
request from the NMS, and report the management data to
the NMS that sends the request.

Ga) ) SNMP Message Exchange
NMs a Managed object e The NMS and managed devices exchange messages in the
Network management following modes:
- process ; so The NMS sends a request for modifying or querying configuration
1) 2.) NN 3 J information to a managed device through SNMP. The agent process
running on the managed device responds to the request from the
ig NMS.
5 The managed device can proactively report traps to the NMS so
that the network administrator can detect faults in a timely
manner.
e Managed object: Each device may contain multiple managed
: — objects. A managed object can be a hardware component or a

A MILB is a database containing the variables that are
maintained by managed devices. (The variables can be
queried or set by the agent processes.) The MIB defines the
attributes of managed devices in the database.
5 Object identifier (OID) of
 
an object
5 Status of an object
o Access permission of an object
o Data types of an object
A MIB provides a structure that contains data on all NEs that
may be managed on the network. Because the data structure
is similar to the tree structure, a MIB is also called an object
naming tree.

Ga) ) SNMP Management Model
e Query/Modify operation:
sc The NMS sends an SNMP request message to an agent
process.
c The agent process searches the MIB on the device for
information to be queried or modified and sends an SNMP
response message to the NMS.
e Trap operation:
c |f the trap triggering conditions defined for a module are
met, the agent process sends a message to notify the NMS
that an event or trap has occurred on a managed object. This
helps network administrators promptly process network
faults.

|= | ) SNMP Summary
SNMP has the following advantages:
o Simplicity: SNMP is applicable to networks that require high speed and low cost because it uses a polling mechanism and provides basic network
management functions. Moreover, SNMP uses UDP to exchange data and therefore is supported by most products.
= Convenience: SNMP allows management information exchange between arbitrary devices on a network, so that a network administrator can
query information and locate faults on any device.
SNMPv1 applies to small-scale networks where security requirements are not high or the network environment is safe and stable,
such as campus networks and small-sized enterprise networks.
SNMPv2c applies to medium- and large-sized networks where security requirements are not high or the network environment is
safe, but a large volume of traffic exists and traffic congestion may occur.
SNMPv3 is the recommended version and applies to networks of various scales, especially those networks that have high security
requirements and allow only authorized administrators to manage network devices.

Ga) Basic SNMP Configuration (1)
1. Enable the SNMP agent function.
[Huawei] snmp-agent
2. Set the SNMP version.
[Huawei] snmp-agent sys-info version [v1 | v2c | v3]
You can configure the SNMP version as required. However, the protocol version used on the device must be the same as that
used on the NMS.
3. Create or update MIB view information.
[Huawei] snmp-agent mib-view view-name { exclude | include } subtree-name [mask mask]
4. Add anew SNMP group and map users in this group to the SNMP view.
[Huawei] snmp-agent group v3 group-name { authentication | noauth | privacy } [ read-view view-name | write-view view-
name | notify-view view-name
 
|]
This command is used to create an SNMP group of the SNMPv3 version and specify the authentication and encryption mode
and one or more of read-only view, read-write view, and notification view. It is a mandatory command on networks that
require high security.

Ga) Basic SNMP Configuration (2)
5. Add a user to the SNMP group.
[Huawei] snmp-agent usm-user v3 user-name group group-name
6. Configure an authentication mode for an SNMPv3 user.
[Huawei] snmp-agent usm-user v3 user-name authentication-mode { md5 | sha | sha2-256 }
7. Configure the SNMPv3 user encryption mode.
[Huawei] snmp-agent usm-user v3 user-name privacy-mode { aes128 | des56 }
8. Set parameters for sending trap messages.
[Huawei] snmp-agent target-host trap-paramsname paramsname v3 securityname securityname { authentication |
noauthnopriv | privacy
 
}

9. Configure the target host of traps.
[Huawei] snmp-agent target-host trap-hostname hostname address ipv4-address trap-paramsname paramsname
10. Enable all trap functions.
[Huawei] snmp-agent trap enable
Note that this command is used only to enable the device to send traps. This command must be used together with the snmp-
agent target-host command. The snmp-agent target-host command specifies the device to which traps are sent.
11. Configure the source interface that sends traps.
[Huawei] snmp-agent trap source interface-type interface-number
Note that a source IP address must have been configured for the interface that sends traps.

Remote procedure Call
e The programming of distributed applications is difficult. In addition to the usual tasks, programmers who build
clients and servers must deal with the complex issues of communication. Although many of the needed functions
are supplied by a standard API such as the socket interface, the socket calls require the programmer to specify many
low level details as names ,addresses,protocols and ports.

YANG Language Overview
Yet Another Next Generation (YANG) is a data modeling language that standardizes NETCONF data content.
The YANG model defines the hierarchical structure of data and can be used for NETCONF-based operations. Modeling objects
include configuration, status data, remote procedure calls, and notifications. This allows a complete description of all data
exchanged between a NETCONF client and server.
A model is an abstraction and expression of things.
