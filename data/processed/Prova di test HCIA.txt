tips
• Blackhole MAC address entries can be used to filter out invalid MAC 
addresses. To prevent a hacker from using a MAC address to attack a 
user device or network, configure the MAC address of an untrusted
user as the blackhole MAC address. The switch directly discards the 
received packets where the source or destination MAC address is the 
blackhole MAC address and the VLAN ID of the packets corresponds 
to the blackhole MAC address.
• NOTE: The switch forwards Layer 3 packets with the source MAC 
addresses matching blackhole MAC address entries.
• In system-view run: 
• [Switch] mac-address blackhole mac-address vlan vlan-id

Tips Hello and Dead Intervals in OSPF
• https://support.huawei.com/enterprise/it/doc/EDOC1100112917/ca1
7a1dd/ospfv3-timer-dead 
• The dead interval of switches in the same network segment must be 
consistent.
• https://support.huawei.com/enterprise/it/doc/EDOC1100112496/f25
6ded6/ospfv3-timer-hello
• Ensure that the parameters of this interface and the adjacent routers are 
consistent.

Tips OSPF cost
• If no cost is set for an OSPF interface using the ospf cost command, 
OSPF automatically calculates its cost based on the interface 
bandwidth. The calculation formula is as follows: 
• Cost of the interface = Bandwidth reference value/Interface bandwidth. 
• The integer of the calculated result is the cost of the interface. If the 
calculated result is smaller than 1, the cost is 1.
• Cost is a positive integer value.
• Any decimal value would be rounded back in nearest positive integer.
• Any value below 1 would be considered as 1.
• Cumulative cost = Sum of all outgoing interfaces cost in route

Tips DHCPv6
• The DHCPv6 information refresh option can specify an upper 
boundary for the length of time a client should wait before refreshing 
information retrieved from DHCPv6.
if the DHCPv6 server DUID carried in the Rebind message is not the DHCPv6 server's DUID, the DHCPv6 server does not respond to the Rebind message. If the DHCPv6 
server DUID carried in the Rebind message is the DHCPv6 server's DUID, the DHCPv6 server checks the IPv6 address carried in the message. If the check passes, the 
DHCPv6 server replies with a Reply message carrying the IPv6 address with a new lifetime, T1', and T2' to the DHCPv6 client.

Tips: Static routes
• When creating static routes, you can specify both the outbound 
interface and next hop. Alternatively, you can specify only the 
outbound interface or next hop based on the outbound interface 
type. Specify the outbound interface for P2P interfaces.
• Specify the next hop for non broadcast multiple access (NBMA) 
interfaces.
• Specify the next hop for broadcast interfaces (for example, Ethernet 
interfaces)
